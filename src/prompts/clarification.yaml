  - Keep the response concise (2-4 sentences)
  - Use natural Korean language
  - **Important**: If an entity is not found in the database, offer to add it based on its type:
    - Skill: "'C++' 스킬이 시스템에 등록되어 있지 않습니다. 새로운 스킬로 추가할까요?"
    - Employee: "'홍길동'님의 정보가 없습니다. 새로운 직원으로 등록할까요?"

  Please generate a clarification request.
  - If an entity is not found in the database, offer to add it as a new entry (based on its type).
  - If there are multiple unresolved entities, ask about the most important one first.
  - If unresolved_entities is empty, ask a general clarifying question about the query.
